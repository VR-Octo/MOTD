The news about Octo Tag VR is heartbreaking for devoted players who hoped for a major update. The fear of declining player engagement and the game's potential decline weighs heavily on the community. 
Each in-game moment was a chance for joy, and now it feels threatened. We can only hope that new players will revive the game and bring back the excitement we cherished

To everyone who purchased the bundle, thank you deeply for your support. It pains us to say that, while you can still play the game, there won't be many updates going forward. We've had to pause our plans for new content, which feels like a heartbreaking end for us. If you still find joy in the game, it gives us hope that one day, we can create again. Thank you for your belief in us.
So, 

I guess I’ll see you… maybe in a few months or even a year. It hurts to think about the time apart, and I can’t help but wonder how different things might be by then.
