Hello everyone! We have some good news: we are starting to work on Octo Tag VR again. Our goal is to make the game less buggy and improve the overall experience. We will also be removing the Early Access bundle soon. For those who refunded their purchases or didn't buy the game, you will have one last chance to obtain the rare bundle and cosmetics, which will be exclusive to this version. For now, we're focused on game development, and we look forward to sharing the next big update with you!
